# AltTrackr
An implementation of CoinGecko's HTML ticker into a .NET application. <br />
A desktop widget with live AltCoin (and Bitcoin) prices.

Right click the widget and choose preferences to change coin, fiat, opacity, width and taskbar icon visibility. <br />
Click and drag the widget around to move it, it'll remember where you put it for next launch.

Primitive UI, but that happens with only a couple hours of devtime. <br />
Feel free to expand on AltTrackr, or do whatever you like with it. Effectively licensed under WTFPL.

The AltTrackr Widget has been deprecated, a fully fledged crypto tracker and wallet is under development at https://github.com/Maega/AltTrackr2
